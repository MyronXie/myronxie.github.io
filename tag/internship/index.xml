      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Sep 2017 to Oct 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participate in the writing and testing of multi-rotor UAV accompanying computer embedded control software. Accompanying the computer using STM32F3 as the main control chip, its main functions are: controlling the onboard landing gear to carry out the retracting operation smoothly; controlling the power state of the onboard smart battery, and real-time collection of battery voltage, current, power and other related information; establishment Two-way communication with the drone&amp;rsquo;s onboard flight controller, receiving control signals to control the landing gear and smart battery, and sending the status information of the onboard equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participate in the writing and testing of the software and hardware of the multi-rotor UAV flight controller. The flight control software is written in a Unix-like environment. The main tasks include: Responsible for the driver writing and testing of UAV airborne sensors; research and optimize sensor data acquisition algorithms, processing algorithms and fusion algorithms, improve the stability of UAV attitude calculation; test flight controller hardware circuit boards Reliability, and make suggestions for improvement based on the problems encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assist in the completion of other embedded-related projects within the company: a smart car that can run on a preset route through a remote control handle and take pictures of the goods on the shelf; monitor the vibration of the vibration state of each mechanical part of the drone through multiple accelerometers Recorder etc.&lt;/p&gt;
