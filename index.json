In the massive data and irregular data, sentiment classification with high accuracy is a major challenge in sentiment analysis. To address this problem, a novel maximum entropy-PLSA model is proposed. In this model, we first use the probabilistic latent semantic analysis to extract the seed emotion words from the Wikipedia and the training corpus. Then features are extracted from these seed emotion words, which are the input of the maximum entropy model for training the maximum entropy model. The test set is processed similarly into the maximum entropy model for emotional classification. Meanwhile, the training set and the test set are divided by the K-fold method. The maximum entropy classification based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis uses important emotional classification features to classify words, such as the relevance of words and parts of speech in the context, the relevance with degree adverbs, the similarity with the benchmark emotional words and so on. The experiments prove that the classification method proposed by this paper outperforms the compared methods.","tags":[],"title":"An improved algorithm for sentiment analysis based on maximum entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Xie","Songlin Ge","Mingye Xie","Fengping Hu","Nan Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"51630fb204e28bc1ed569e4e18a5b529","permalink":"https://myronxie.github.io/publication/xie2020improved/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xie2020improved/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, an improved sub-pixel edge detection algorithm combining coarse and precise location is proposed.

In order to solve the problem of low efficiency of the Zernike moment method in threshold selection, the Otsu’s method is introduced to achieve accurate sub-pixel edge location.

With the continuous investment of commercial companies, research institutes and open source communities, the technology related to multi-rotor drones has developed vigorously.\nThe sensor system, as part of a multi-rotor drone, continuously provides reliable sensor raw data for the drone. The sensor data is finally converted into state information such as flight attitude and flight position of the drone through various algorithms within the system, which provides a basis for the multi-rotor UAV to achieve autonomous control. This paper uses the Pixhawk open source flight control system, based on the self-designed and built flight control software and hardware platform, the following research and design of the multi-rotor UAV sensor system:\n The selection of sensor hardware was studied and evaluated. By comparing and verifying the performance parameters of each sensor, the MEMS sensor selection suitable for multi-rotor UAVs was selected. Research and implementation of sensor data processing algorithms. By analyzing the sensor error source and error type, the corresponding error model is established, and data processing methods such as data calibration processing, temperature compensation processing and data filtering processing are introduced according to this model to reduce the correlation error to the sensor data. The sensor data fusion algorithm and the UAV attitude calculation algorithm are studied and implemented. The multi-sensor fusion mechanism avoids the impact of a single sensor failure on the sensor system. Different types of sensor information are fused by introducing corresponding complementary filtering algorithms to reduce the error that occurs when the UAV attitude is solved.  Through the above research and design, the sensor system can obtain more accurate and stable sensor raw data, which enables the flight control system to solve more accurate attitude information, and finally make the multi-rotor drone maintain a more stable flight.\n","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"4c5695742822dc2fb29d30d3392ae27f","permalink":"https://myronxie.github.io/project/master-thesis/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/master-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Research and Design of Multi-rotor UAV Sensor System Based on Pixhawk","tags":["Thesis"],"title":"Master Thesis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"From Sep 2017 to Oct 2018.\nParticipate in the writing and testing of multi-rotor UAV accompanying computer embedded control software.
