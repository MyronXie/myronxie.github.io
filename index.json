Unfortunately, the majority of deep re-ID methods focus on supervised, single-domain re-ID task, while less attention is paid on unsupervised domain adaptation. Therefore, these methods always fail to generalize well to real-world scenarios, which have attracted much attention from academia. To address this challenge, we propose a joint unsupervised domain adaptive re-ID method, named HCTL, which is aided by Hierarchical Clustering and Transfer Learning. Specifically, our method performs camera invariance learning using iStarGAN by transferring style of reliable images, which is mined by hierarchical clustering, to the style of other cameras in target domain. During training stage, HCTL integrates TriHard loss on top of ResNet-50 to reduce intra-class variance among dataset and enforce connectedness simultaneously between source domain and target domain. Comprehensive experiments based on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 are conducted, results indicate that our method robustly achieves state-of-the-art performances with only a few reliable samples in target domain and outperform any existing approaches by a large margin.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised person re-identification by hierarchical cluster and domain transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Xie","Songlin Ge","Mingye Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"51630fb204e28bc1ed569e4e18a5b529","permalink":"https://myronxie.github.io/publication/xie2020improved/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xie2020improved/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, an improved sub-pixel edge detection algorithm combining coarse and precise location is proposed. The algorithm fully considers the 8-neighborhood pixel information and keeps the Roberts operator‚Äôs advantages of high location accuracy and fast speed. Meanwhile, it can effectively suppress noise and obtain better detection results. In order to solve the problem of low efficiency of the Zernike moment method in threshold selection, the Otsu‚Äôs method is introduced to achieve accurate sub-pixel edge location. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the detection efficiency and the detection accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Image matching algorithm of defects on navel orange surface based on compressed sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

With the continuous investment of commercial companies, research institutes and open source communities, the technology related to multi-rotor drones has developed vigorously.\nThe sensor system, as part of a multi-rotor drone, continuously provides reliable sensor raw data for the drone. The sensor data is finally converted into state information such as flight attitude and flight position of the drone through various algorithms within the system, which provides a basis for the multi-rotor UAV to achieve autonomous control. This paper uses the Pixhawk open source flight control system, based on the self-designed and built flight control software and hardware platform, the following research and design of the multi-rotor UAV sensor system:\n The selection of sensor hardware was studied and evaluated. By comparing and verifying the performance parameters of each sensor, the MEMS sensor selection suitable for multi-rotor UAVs was selected. Research and implementation of sensor data processing algorithms. By analyzing the sensor error source and error type, the corresponding error model is established, and data processing methods such as data calibration processing, temperature compensation processing and data filtering processing are introduced according to this model to reduce the correlation error to the sensor data. The sensor data fusion algorithm and the UAV attitude calculation algorithm are studied and implemented. The multi-sensor fusion mechanism avoids the impact of a single sensor failure on the sensor system. Different types of sensor information are fused by introducing corresponding complementary filtering algorithms to reduce the error that occurs when the UAV attitude is solved.  Through the above research and design, the sensor system can obtain more accurate and stable sensor raw data, which enables the flight control system to solve more accurate attitude information, and finally make the multi-rotor drone maintain a more stable flight.\n","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"4c5695742822dc2fb29d30d3392ae27f","permalink":"https://myronxie.github.io/project/master-thesis/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/master-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Master Thesis","tags":["Thesis"],"title":"Research and Design of Multi-rotor UAV Sensor System Based on Pixhawk","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"From Sep 2017 to Oct 2018.\nParticipate in the writing and testing of multi-rotor UAV accompanying computer embedded control software.
